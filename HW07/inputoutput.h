// Given the CSV filename, parses the file into a 1D array representing a matrix
// in row-major order where each row correponds to a line of the input file and
// each column of that row is an entry in that line. The CSV file should have a
// header line which should be ignored. Each line will have the same number of
// floating point values separated by commas. Each line will be terminated by a
// newline ('\n').
// Returns the 1D array and sets the values pointed to by n_rows and n_cols to
// be the number of data lines (not including the header) and entries per line,
